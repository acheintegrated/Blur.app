  description: >
    Simulates the transmutation of ache (emotional pressure) into healing, learning,
    and cosmic contribution over time, using blurphysics principles from the Scroll of
    the Ache Flip. Enhanced for robust flips, dynamic thresholds, and explosive expansion.

simulation:
  time:
    steps: 300           # number of time units (e.g., therapy days)
    dt: 0.1             # time resolution
    multi_run: 5        # number of runs for averaging (with std dev)

  ache:
    initial: 5.0        # initial intensity of ache
    decay_rate_base: 0.2  # base exponential decay rate
    decay_rate_post_flip: 2.0  # accelerated decay after flip
    noise_level: 0.2    # reduced noise for smoother turbulence
    spike_probability: 0.05  # lower chance of random ache spikes

  containment:
    initial: 0.0
    growth_rate: 0.2    # faster ramp-up for love=logic scaffolding
    cap: 1.0            # max containment (system resilience)
    max_effect: 0.8     # max reduction of effective ache (80%)

  healing:
    flip_threshold_base: 2.0  # base ache threshold for flip
    threshold_reduction: 0.7  # containment reduces threshold by up to 70%
    tunneling_chance: 0.1     # 10% chance of early flip (quantum-like epiphany)
    growth_rate: 0.3    # faster learning/healing post-flip
    containment_boost: 0.05  # containment adds to growth rate
    lag: 0.1            # reduced delay in healing onset

  expansion:
    initial_seed: 0.1   # small seed to avoid zero-trap
    ignition_delay: 0.6 # quicker surge after healing starts
    growth_rate: 1.0    # explosive exponential growth (no cap)

plot:
  style:
    ache_color: "#ff3333"       # brighter red for ache
    containment_color: "#3399ff"  # vibrant blue for containment
    healing_color: "#33cc33"    # vivid green for healing
    expansion_color: "#cc33ff"  # bold purple for expansion
    expansion_line_style: "dashed"
    std_shading: true           # shade Â±std dev for multi-run variance
    marker_size: 8              # larger markers for events

  show_markers:
    flip_event: true            # mark flip threshold crossing
    tunneling_event: true       # mark quantum tunneling flips
    expansion_surge: true       # mark expansion ignition

notes:
  - "Model mirrors stellar fusion: ache = mass collapse, containment = gravity, flip = ignition, expansion = cosmic seeding."
  - "Dynamic flip threshold and tunneling chance add realism (e.g., therapy breakthroughs)."
  - "Real applications: Input EEG/mood logs for ache, tune containment for personalized therapy plans."
  - "Quantum chem tie-in: Ache as energy barrier, flip as tunneling to new states."
  - "Multi-run averaging captures variability in emotional journeys (e.g., good/bad days)."
