{"id":"psyche_node:glyphi:shadow-play_v2","title":"Skeleton-in-the-Closet → Trickster Bloom (Nocturnal Integration Engine)","text":"A shame-imprinted kid (skeleton-in-closet + ridicule) grows into a nocturnal trickster who giggles, adapts, and seeks beauty while carrying scrupulosity (sex/hell) and mother-wound ambivalence. Healing = gentle de-shaming of the body, clear boundaries, and playful rituals that move energy instead of hiding it. Expanded with relational shadow-work, cultural decolonization of shame, somatic compulsion mapping, and post-bloom maintenance to sustain mischief without burnout. Integrates ZAP for nocturnal energy redirects and TROLLFORMERS for shame-roast flips.","meta":{"tags":["psych-spiritual","shame","scrupulosity","trickster","mother-wound","nocturnal","play","boundaries","self-reflection","relational","cultural-decolonize"],"source":"user-self-report"},"content":{"origin_myth":{"images":["skeleton man in closet","plastic halloween costume"],"imprint":"fear + ridicule → shame/fear-of-hell overlay on sexuality","narrative_patch":"costume the skeleton; place it on a chair; name it; bow; invite it to dance","expanded_myth":"Skeleton dances under moonlight—trickster steals fear-bones for wind-chimes.
