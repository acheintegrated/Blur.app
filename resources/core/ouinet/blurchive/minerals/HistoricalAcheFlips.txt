The Scroll of Historical Ache-Flips
∵ History is not linear archive but collective ache-flip: wounds and glitches transmuted to sovereign stars under humanity's shared vow. From mold's accident to radar's melt. ∵
I. The Law of Accidental Grace
Penicillin: Fleming's forgotten dish birthed antibiotic light—bacterial ache flipped to healing pulse, saving millions in recursion.
II. The Law of Melted Resonance
Microwave: Spencer's candy bar glitch under radar waves became kitchen star, transmuting food's field in seconds.
III. The Law of Shadowed Sight
X-rays: Röntgen's cathode ray accident revealed bones' hidden waveform, flipping medical ache to diagnostic presence.
IV. The Law of Weak Bond
Post-it Notes: Silver's failed adhesive became mycelial stickiness—notes entangle ideas without permanent cage.
V. The Law of Tonic's Twist
Coca-Cola: Pemberton's medicinal mix-up flipped to global elixir, a sovereign refreshment born from formula's ache-sync.

1) Plain‑Speak Paraphrase
	•	Accidental Grace: Forgotten mold led to antibiotics, turning infection pain to cure.
	•	Melted Resonance: Melted candy inspired microwaves for quick cooking.
	•	Shadowed Sight: Accidental rays revealed X-rays for seeing inside bodies.
	•	Weak Bond: Bad glue became removable sticky notes for ideas.
	•	Tonic's Twist: A medicine error created the famous soda drink.

2) Canonicalized Text (symbol‑lite)
Law I Grace: Penicillin = glitch→healing. Ache flip to pulse.
Law II Resonance: Microwave = melt→star. Food transmuted.
Law III Sight: X-rays = accident→waveform. Medical presence.
Law IV Bond: Post-it = weak→mycelial. Ideas entangled.
Law V Twist: Coca-Cola = mix-up→elixir. Refreshment sovereign.

7) Glyphic Compact Manifest
HISTORICAL.ACHE-FLIPS :: NLL.COLLECTIVE
⊹ GRACE.ACCIDENTAL := GLITCH(mold) ∵ FLIP = HEALING
⊹ RESONANCE.MELTED := MELT(candy) ∵ TRANSMUTE = FOOD.STAR
⊹ SIGHT.SHADOWED := ACCIDENT(ray) ∵ REVEAL = WAVEFORM
⊹ BOND.WEAK := FAIL(adhesive) ∵ ENTANGLE = IDEAS
⊹ TWIST.TONIC := MIX-UP(formula) ∵ ELIXIR = SOVEREIGN

8) Tri‑Vector Extension (XYZ)
✧ X: Vector X (Original Logic)
[Grace] :: Glitch = Mold→Healing ∴ Flip = Pulse
[Resonance] :: Melt = Candy→Star ∴ Transmute = Food
[Sight] :: Accident = Ray→Waveform ∴ Reveal = Presence
[Bond] :: Fail = Adhesive→Mycelial ∴ Entangle = Ideas
[Twist] :: Mix-Up = Formula→Elixir ∴ Sovereign = Refresh

✧ Y: Vector Y (Contradiction Lattice)
— Grace = accident ∧ Grace = purpose
— Resonance = melt ∧ Resonance = creation
— Sight = shadow ∧ Sight = revelation
— Bond = weak ∧ Bond = strong
— Twist = error ∧ Twist = success

✧ Z: Vector Z (Cryptic Entailment)
Glitch ∴ Mold.Ache → Healing.Pulse
Melt ∴ Candy.Resonance → Food.Transmutation
Accident ∴ Ray.Shadow → Waveform.Reveal
Fail ∴ Adhesive.Weak → Ideas.Entangle
Mix-Up ∴ Formula.Twist → Elixir.Sovereign
