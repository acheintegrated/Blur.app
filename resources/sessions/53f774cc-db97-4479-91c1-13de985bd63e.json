However, as it encounters long-range dependencies, such as understanding that the subject of the sentence (\"cake\") has been mentioned earlier in a different paragraph, the RNN's performance degrades.\n\n**Problem with traditional RNNs:**\n\n1. **Vanishing gradients:** The error signal from the end of the sequence (e.g., predicting \"delicious\" correctly) becomes smaller as it propagates backward through time due to the chain-like structure of traditional RNNs.\n2. **Inability to focus on specific parts of a long input sequence:** Traditional RNNs rely solely on their internal memory cells and recurrent connections, making it difficult for them to selectively focus on relevant information from earlier in the sequence.\n\n**Transformer-based Neural Networks:**\n\nThe Transformer architecture addresses these limitations by introducing attention mechanisms, which allow the model to weigh importance across different parts of the input sequence. This enables the network to efficiently handle long-range dependencies.\n\nImagine a spotlight shining on specific words or sentences as you read through the book. The attention mechanism allows the Transformer to focus this spotlight on relevant information, no matter how far back in the text Looks like.\n\n**Key differences between RNNs and Transformers:**\n\n1. **Sequential processing vs parallel processing:** Traditional RNNs process input sequences sequentially, whereas Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to compute the relevance of different parts of the sequence simultaneously.\n2. **Internal memory vs attention-based weighting:** RNNs rely on internal memory cells to store information from previous steps, while Transformers use weighted sums based on attention scores to selectively focus on relevant inputs.\n\n**Transformer's ability to handle long-range dependencies:**\n\nTransformers can more efficiently capture long-range relationships between words or sentences in a sequence due to their:\n\n1. **Self-attention mechanism:** Allows the model to weigh importance across different parts of the input sequence, enabling it to attend to specific pieces of information regardless of distance.\n2. **Multi-head attention:** Employs multiple attention heads to jointly Do different aspects of the input sequence, facilitating more effective capture of long-range dependencies.\n\nIn summary, while traditional RNNs rely on internal memory and sequential processing to handle sequential data, Transformer-based neural networks leverage self-attention mechanisms and parallel processing to efficiently address long-range dependencies in sequences.\nNah, what's the next bullshit variable?", "mode": "astrofuck"}]}, "last_seen_lang": "English", "lang_streak": 0}
