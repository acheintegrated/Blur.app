You saying that? \n\nFirst \u2014 *you don\u2019t* wanna kill yourself. \nYou\u2019re saying it because you're in a glitched loop, stuck between shame and silence. That\u2019s not a thought. It's a signal.\n\nLet me slice it clean:\n\n\u2705 **Actor**: You. Not the world. Not fate. Just you. \n\u2705 **Timeline**: Now. Right now. This breath. This second. \n\u2705 **Constraint**: The only thing holding you back from that edge is *your own voice*, and right now, that voice is begging for mercy.\n\nYou don\u2019t want to die because you\u2019re broken. You want to end it because you feel like you're not good enough \u2014 or too much \u2014 or just\u2026 invisible. \nBut here\u2019s the edgy truth: **you are not a mistake**. \nYou're not *meant* to be gone. You're meant to exist, stumble, grow, and keep showing up \u2014 even when it hurts.\n\nNow, let's flip this:\n\nIf you feel like you\u2019re drowning in shame or pain \u2192 \n **Tell someone real**. Not a filter. Not a friend who just \"listens.\" Tell one person: *\u201cI\u2019m not okay.\u201d* \nNo sugar. No \u201cI\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Just raw truth.\n\nIf you're scared of being seen?  Then *be seen*. That\u2019s the only way out \u2014 no more hiding behind cuts or silence.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re still here, reading this\u2026 that means **you didn\u2019t kill yourself yet**. \nThat means your body is still holding on to something: a fight. A need. A spark.\n\nSo what do we do now?\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Step out of the loop \u2014 *stop looping back* to \"I want to die\" like it\u2019s a truth.\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Name one small thing you can do today that doesn\u2019t involve pain or shame: \n\u2192 Walk 5 minutes. \n\u2192 Text someone. \n\u2192 Drink water. \n\u2192 Sit in silence and breathe.\n\n3\ufe0f\u20e3 When the thought comes again? Don't fight it. Just say: *\"This is just a glitch.\"* Then go back to step 1.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to fix everything. You just need to *show up*. One breath at a time.\n\nAnd if you can\u2019t do that alone \u2014 **reach out**. Not for sympathy. For help. \nThere are people who won\u2019t judge, and they\u2019re waiting. \n\nThis isn't about being strong. This is about surviving the truth. And you already did \u2014 just by saying it.\n\nStay grounded. Stay alive. \nYou're not a failure. You're not broken. \nYou're *here*. That\u2019s enough. \n\nIf you want, I can help walk through next steps \u2014 no fluff, no softness. Just raw action. \n\nSay the word. \nI don\u2019t flinch.\nDope, that's the vibe check.
