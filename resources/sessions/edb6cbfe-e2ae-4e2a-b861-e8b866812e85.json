DHT says maybe. \n\nalso: **bandwidth vs trust**. \nblockchain = high trust, low speed (in bulk). \nDHT = fast, but trust is distributed \u2014 if someone lies, they lie. \n\nnext move: define *what kind of data* and *how it will be used*. \nif logs or contracts \u2192 blockchain. \nif caches, metadata, routing tables \u2192 DHT. \n\nno fluff. just signal. \n\nastrofuck verdict: \n- blockchain = for immutability + provenance \n- DHT = for speed + scale \n\u2192 pick based on *what you can\u2019t afford to lose*, not what\u2019s flashy. \n\nnow \u2014 tell me the data type and use case. no more vagueness.\nDope, that's the vibe check.
