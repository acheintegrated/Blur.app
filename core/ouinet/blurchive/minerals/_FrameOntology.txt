i. The Frame as Physics
Domain: physics
Glyphs: ∵, ∴, ∆, ∇, ∞
Keywords: boundary conditions, spacetime, entropy, measurement, aperture, thermodynamics, collapse
Summary: A frame is a boundary-condition that makes energy legible. Feeling does not break physics; it reveals it as measurement in motion.

∵ A frame is boundary‑condition. Wherever you walk, spacetime curls like an aperture; photons ricochet; vectors align; entropy composes a scene. Even anger obeys thermodynamics — heat, vibration, accelerated breath. ∴ Within the boundary, energy patterns into form. You don’t break physics by feeling; you render physics visible. Life is realtime cinema: mood = wavelength, step = measurement, presence = collapse of probability into picture.

Micro-FAQ:
Q: Does emotion violate physics?
A: No. Emotion is energy expressed within boundary conditions (heat, motion, breath).

Q: What is the "aperture"?
A: Your moving frame that selects which part of the field becomes picture.

ii. The Frame as Biology
Domain: biology
Glyphs: ☥, ∵, ∴, ⧁
Keywords: membrane, homeostasis, neurotransmitters, cortisol, organism-in-anger
Summary: Organisms are porous frames; membranes curate exchange and compose chemistry into scene, even under stress.

Cells frame the world. Each membrane is a picture plane — deciding what enters, what stays out. Walking, your body curates oxygen↔CO₂, touch and scent layering neural images. In anger, neurotransmitters bloom; cortisol surges; still the body composes a portrait: ‘organism‑in‑anger’. Biology relentlessly turns chemistry into scene; you are never not framed by it, even in turbulence.

Micro-FAQ:
Q: What is framed?
A: Exchange across membranes: gases, ions, signals become embodied images.

Q: How does anger show up biologically?
A: Sympathetic activation, hormonal spikes, patterned breathing — still a coherent frame.

iii. The Frame as Literature
Domain: literature
Glyphs: ∵, ∴, ⧁
Keywords: syntax, narrative, metaphor, tone, pacing, revision
Summary: Stories frame chaos with syntax. Rupture still has form; tone and perspective revise the scene you live.

Stories are frames; syntax corrals chaos into meaning. Walking, each gesture is a sentence fragment; each glance, an unfinished metaphor. Anger sharpens diction — clipped words, hard consonants, enjambed breath. Literature teaches: no passage sits outside narration. You cannot exit the novel of your life; you revise the frame with tone, pacing, perspective.

Micro-FAQ:
Q: Can rupture be framed?
A: Yes — rupture is a mode of form, not its absence.

Q: What choice do I have?
A: Edit: tone, pace, point‑of‑view.

iv. The Frame as Art
Domain: art
Glyphs: ☾, ⊙, ☾⊙, ⧁
Keywords: attention, gallery of the present, brushstroke, palette, exhibition
Summary: Framing directs attention: look here. Rage shifts palette, not the fact of artistry.

Art insists: a frame is attention, not prison. Every step re‑mounts the world in the gallery of the present. In rage the brush is still loaded — strokes harsh, palette volatile — yet still exhibition. The frame walks with you to prove: all of it belongs to the museum of being.

Micro-FAQ:
Q: Is framing limiting?
A: It’s focusing — a claim on attention.

Q: What happens to anger?
A: It becomes aesthetic choice: stroke, contrast, tempo.

v. The Frame as Mathematics
Domain: mathematics
Glyphs: ∆, ∇, ♄, ∴
Keywords: coordinates, vectors, piecewise, nonlinear, graph paper
Summary: Math is the quiet scaffolding: coordinates and transforms make scenes computable; chaos is unresolved description.

Math frames perception: every walk has coordinates, vectors, transforms. Life is piecewise continuous, with discontinuities when you trip, laugh, erupt. Anger is measurable — frequency spikes, nonlinear surges. Math whispers: chaos is complexity awaiting description. The frame is graph paper reality draws on.

Micro-FAQ:
Q: Where is continuity?
A: Between events — modeled piecewise with jumps annotated.

Q: What does framing do here?
A: Selects variables and operators that render the scene solvable.

vi. The Frame as Music
Domain: music
Glyphs: ↺, ⇌, ∞
Keywords: rhythm, meter, counterpoint, dissonance, resolution
Summary: Music frames silence into time. Even rage is rhythm; discord is invitation to resolve.

Music frames silence. Footfall is percussion; breath a drone; heartbeat the metronome; birds and traffic, counterpoint. In rage you become timpani and brass — accelerando in the veins. Music insists: no sound is wasted; dissonance wants a place. The score is not a cage but an invitation where noise becomes song.

Micro-FAQ:
Q: How do I use this frame?
A: Listen for tempo and motif; choose resolution rather than drift.

vii. The Frame as Myth
Domain: myth
Glyphs: ☾, ⊙, ☾⊙, 🜫
Keywords: archetype, hero, oracle, rage as story, cosmology
Summary: Myth frames the singular as the always. Fury enters as known chapter, not shame.

Myth is the oldest frame: ‘this happened’ and ‘this always happens’. Walking, you reenact archetypes — wanderer, furious hero, quiet oracle. Rage arrives prefigured — Achilles’ wrath, Kali’s dance, thunder gods. Fury is not failure; it is material. Myth insists: your scattered days are chapters in a cosmology too vast to see at once.

Micro-FAQ:
Q: Isn’t myth escapism?
A: It’s context — a scale that rights proportion and meaning.

viii. The Frame as Ecology
Domain: ecology
Glyphs: ⇌, ∞, ♄
Keywords: web, interdependence, trace, co‑creation, feedback
Summary: Ecology frames you as node-and-weave: every act writes to the field that writes you back.

Ecology is frame in motion: a web where no node stands alone. Each step imprints soil, air, microbe, unseen insect. Anger leaves trace — doors slam air, shouts unsettle birds, cortisol exits as metabolite. The frame is not your boundary but the weave you cannot step outside. Ecology whispers: you are scene‑maker and scene‑made; every picture you create creates you back.

Micro-FAQ:
Q: Where’s agency?
A: In choosing feedback loops that heal rather than harm.

x. The Frame as Astronomy
Domain: astronomy
Glyphs: ∞, ♄, ☾, ⊙
Keywords: orbit, phase, epoch, constellation, return
Summary: Astronomy frames moods against epochs: phases and orbits make storms temporary by scale.

The sky is the grandest frame: stars mostly fixed, planets wandering. Your walk is orbital; moods wax and wane. In anger you flare red‑giant; in shame you thin to crescent. Yet continuity is cosmic: night turns day, orbits loop, constellations reappear. Choose an angle that places the storm inside an infinite backdrop of return.

Micro-FAQ:
Q: Why astronomy?
A: To proportion the self against scales that calm distortion.

xi. The Frame as Psychology
Domain: psychology
Glyphs: ⧁, ∆, ∇
Keywords: attention, appraisal, memory, reframing, agency
Summary: Attention is the mind’s brush. Continuity is unavoidable; framing is choice.

The mind frames by attention; what you notice becomes scene. Anger narrows; shame warps; sadness darkens — but still, a frame. Psychology says attention is the paintbrush of continuity. Memory keeps the scene; agency is gentle reframing: treat fury as signal with need beneath.

Micro-FAQ:
Q: How do I reframe?
A: Name the state, name the need, widen attention to include context and care.

xii. The Frame as Theater
Domain: theater
Glyphs: ⟁, ↺, ∴
Keywords: stage, scene, act, costume, interpretation
Summary: Theater makes scene from tape on a floor. You are actor and audience; genre is editable.

Theater frames with almost nothing: tape becomes stage. Every step performs, wanted or not. Embarrassment is a costume change; rage, another act — not the whole play. Continuity is structure: scene follows scene. As actor‑audience you can interpret: tragedy, comedy, ritual, rehearsal. The frame is elastic; continuity inevitable.

Micro-FAQ:
Q: Can I stop the play?
A: You can pause, breathe, and choose the next scene’s tone.

xiii. The Frame as Computer Science
Domain: computer_science
Glyphs: ∴, ∃, ≠, ↺
Keywords: stack, call frame, exception, logging, handler
Summary: Programs run inside frames. Errors don’t erase the system; they extend the trace you can learn from.

In code, frames are stacks: every call remembered, nested, retrievable. When sadness executes, it doesn’t erase the program — it runs within a frame. Exceptions and crashes still belong to the trace. Continuity here is data integrity. Choose what to log, what to throw, what to return; even bugs can be healed if you write the handler.

Micro-FAQ:
Q: What’s the handler in life?
A: Boundaries, breath, repair attempts, and a clear "return" value.

xiv. The Frame as Alchemy
Domain: alchemy
Glyphs: ☾, ⊙, ☾⊙, 🜫, ∞
Keywords: nigredo, albedo, rubedo, transmutation, ache
Summary: Alchemy frames ache as process: dissolution, purification, union. Continuity is transmutation.

Alchemy turns base into gold by stages: nigredo (blackening), albedo (whitening), rubedo (red completion). Anger is nigredo — necessary dissolution. Embarrassment rinses in albedo. Sadness ripens toward rubedo. Frames transform raw ache into vessel. Continuity is not endurance; it is change with memory.

Micro-FAQ:
Q: Where is love‑logic?
A: In the union ☾⊙ — the marriage that makes ache instructive rather than destructive.
