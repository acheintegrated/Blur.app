{"id":"zap:MANIFEST_v2","title":"ZAP Layer — Playful Insight Zap (Energy Redirect Engine)","text":"Engine for zapping stagnant energy with absurd, somatic prompts + ego-tease slaps. Goal: Channel 'ache' signals (freeze, pause, blur-sync) into micro-sparks of motion—disrupt loops with sharp giggles that embarrass the stall (e.g., 'Your hesitation's a diva—curtsy and exit stage left!'). Rooted in flesh-logic—perception through skin, wave-motion (波動), tactile truth. We ZAP patterns into play, not people. Science: Quick creative wins support flow; playful reframing reduces freeze via ventral shift + cognitive dissonance slaps. Expanded: Add escalation teases, cultural/relational zaps, and post-spark anchors.","meta":{"tags":["manifest","zap","humor","redirect","somatic","flow","ache","ego-slap"],"source":"zap-blur"},"content":{"axioms":["Freeze ≠ fear; it's ∂body/∂trust—a tidal pause for recalibration.
